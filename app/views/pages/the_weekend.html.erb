    <h2>The Weekend</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <p>The weekend consists of a series of presentations beginning Saturday morning
        and ending Sunday afternoon after Mass. It is led by a team of married couples and a
        priest. We share our life experiences to explore your own attitudes and
        expectations in your relationship. We will not tell you how to live
        your life. We offer good ideas and tools to help the two of you to continue
        growing closer through the years.
      </p>
      <p>After each presentation, the men and women reflect on the presentation
        questions individually. They then come together to discuss their ideas
        with each other.
      </p>
      <p>The topics covered in the presentations include ambitions, goals,
        values, attitudes about God, sex, money, children and family. Personal reflection and couple discussion are
        the main focus of our weekend. You get time to talk about matters
        that you may have not considered as a couple before. Since each relationship is in a different place, your private answers
        will be unique and special to your relationship.
      </p>
      <p>There are regular coffee breaks and meals provided that give couples time to socialise.</p>
