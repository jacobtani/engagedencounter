  <h2>The Weekend</h2>
  <hr>
  <div class="row">
    <p>The weekend consists of a series of presentations beginning Saturday at 8am
      and ending Sunday afternoon after Mass. It is led by a team of married couples and a
      priest. Members of the presenting team talk about what the Sacrament of
      Matrimony means to them individually and the impact a great marriage
      can have on the world. We will not tell you how to live your life.
      Instead, our stories are meant to encourage you to explore your own
      attitudes and expectations in your relationship. We will offer
      some good ideas and tools to help the two of you to continue
      growing closer through the years.
    </p>
    <p>After each presentation is made, the men and women answer the
      presentation questions individually for 10-15 minutes. When time is
      up, each person meets their fiance and reads their answer. After reading
      each other's answers you can privately reflect about what was written.
    </p>
    <p>The topics covered in the presentations include your ambitions, goals,
      attitudes about God, sex, money, children, family, and your role in
      the church and community. Personal reflection and couple discussion are
      the main focus of our weekend. You get time to talk about the matters
      that you wouldn't usually be able to talk about in your daily life.
      Since each relationship is in a different place, your private answers
      will be unique and special to your relationship.
    </p>
    <p>There are regular coffee breaks and meals provided that gives each
      couple time to socialise. Other than this, there are no other group dynamics.
