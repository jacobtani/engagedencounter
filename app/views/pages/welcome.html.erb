      <p>Catholic Engaged Encounter is a worldwide marriage preparation course
        for couples contemplating marriage, whether already engaged or just
        thinking about a future together. It strengthens commitment by making
        couples think about many different aspects of married life, asking
        themselves (and their partner) the hard questions or the very obvious
        but unspoken ones. The weekend "away from it all" helps iron out
        many issues that could be major hurdles or challenges to compatability
        and gives couples an unparalleled opportunity to form a closer bond
        to each other and create a proven and solid foundation for a happy
        future.
      </p>
      <p>The weekend in Wellington is open to any engaged couple wanting to
        prepare for a deeper, more meaningful life together in a marriage
        recognised by the Catholic Church according to its Church law.
        It is open to couples of other faiths, or couples with no
        particular church experience. We do not seek to convert
        anyone who attends. The weekend is focused on your
        relationship.
