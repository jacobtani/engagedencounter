Dear <%= @attendee.full_name %>,

This is to confirm your registration to an Engaged Encounter weekend on <%= @attendee.preferred_event %>. We look forward to meeting you on this weekend.

The weekend is held at St Teresa's Catholic Church Presbytery, Karori. It is a warm and comfortable venue. We want you to feel relaxed and comfortable on the weekend and recommend casual
clothing. You might want to walk around the garden so appropriate clothing for Wellingtons wind might be useful.
Notebooks and pens are supplied so just bring yourselves!

The event runs from Saturday 8am - 8pm and Sunday 8.45am - 4pm. Please note that breakfast is not provided on Saturday or Sunday but the rest of the weekend is fully catered.
Please contact us as soon as possible if you have any special dietary requirements.

In the week leading up to the weekend a member of the presenting team will phone you. Please ask them anything else you need to know to enable you to enjoy the weekend.
We wish you all the very best for your EE Weekend and trust you will enjoy the time as you focus on each other and your future life together.

Cheers,
Fred and Yvonnne Browning (EE Coordinators)
