          "question": "What is Catholic Engaged Encounter?",
          "answer": "It is a weekend designed for couples who are preparing for marriage. While it is spent with other engaged couples, private time is available for the couple to build a closer relationship. The weekend provides an opportunity for each couple to talk privately, honestly and intensely about their future lives together - their strengths and weaknesses; desires; ambitions; goals; their attitudes about money, sex, values, lifestyles, family, and their role in the church and society. Research indicates that couples who possess good communication, problem-solving, and decision-making skills stand a much better chance of their marriage lasting and being a partnership that is filled with continuing fun, love, and intimacy. Engaged Encounter is not designed to take the place of several interviews that must be held with the marriage celebrant, who will discuss, among other things the teachings of the Catholic Church, the Church's view of marriage and the meaning of the ceremony.

However, attendance can be meaningful any time during the engagement. The weekend is not directly a preparation for the wedding day, so it shouldn't be left to the busy period just before the wedding, when there are many distractions and other details to attend to.",
