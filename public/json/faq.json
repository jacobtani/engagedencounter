          "question": "What is Catholic Engaged Encounter?",
          "answer": "It is a weekend designed for couples who are preparing for marriage. While it is spent with other engaged couples, private time is available for the couple to build a closer relationship. The weekend provides an opportunity for each couple to talk privately, honestly and intensely about their future lives together - their strengths and weaknesses; desires; ambitions; goals; their attitudes about money, sex, values, lifestyles, family, and their role in the church and society. Research indicates that couples who possess good communication, problem-solving, and decision-making skills stand a much better chance of their marriage lasting and being a partnership that is filled with continuing fun, love, and intimacy. Engaged Encounter is not designed to take the place of several interviews that must be held with the marriage celebrant, who will discuss, among other things the teachings of the Catholic Church, the Church's view of marriage and the meaning of the ceremony.

  {
          "question": "Why should we attend?",
          "answer": "Other than being a requirement to attend one of these courses for marriage in a Catholic Church, our motto is a 'A wedding is a day, a marriage is a lifetime'. Think of all the preparation you have done for your career or job. Most us spend years studying or learning. Think of the preparation taken for your wedding day. Most people spend months planning and many dollars preparing for their wedding. But how much time and effort do we spend preparing for what we hope will last 50 or 60 years â€“ our marriage?. Ask yourself this question, 'Am I willing to spend 20 hours devoted to hearing ideas and learning skills that will help to make my marriage the best it can be?.'",

  {
          "question": "When should a couple attend?",
          "answer": "To receive the programme's maximum benefit, a weekend should be experienced as early as possible, even before the formal engagement if desired. However, attendance can be meaningful any time during the engagement period. The weekend is not directly a preparation for the wedding day, so it shouldn't be left to the busy period just before the wedding, when there are many distractions and other details to attend to. The weekend gives you areas to improve in personally for your own relationship before your wedding day so you should aim to do it the earlier the better.",

          "answer": "Through a series of ideas presented by a team of trained married couples, the engaged couple is encouraged to privately discuss all aspects of their forthcoming married life. Their discussion is always from the viewpoint of their own relationship. Personal reflection and discussion between the couple becomes the main focus of the weekend. Coffee breaks and meal times provide an opportunity for couples to socialise.",

          "question": "Is it open to those who are not Catholics?",
          "answer": "Yes. Although the weekend is designed for couples who are being married in the Catholic Church, the emphasis is on relationship education and is relevant to those of another religion or those who have no religion. It is common for couples to come where one person is Catholic and the other person has no religion. We would recommend getting your fiance to read the Feedback page to read about past attendees experiences during the weekend (they are relevant).",

          "question": "Is Catholicism pushed?",
          "answer": "No. The focus of the weekend is your relationship. As most of the team are Catholics, some of their sharings will reflect their own religious faith. The weekend is about Christian values common to all Christian faiths. However you can take your own interpretation of the talks based on your own relationship.",
