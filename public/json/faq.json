          "answer": "It is a weekend designed for couples who are preparing for marriage.

Research indicates that lasting marriages are a result of good communication, problem-solving and decision-making. These are skills which are reinforced in this course.

          "answer": "Our motto is: 'A wedding is a day, a marriage is a lifetime'. Attending a marriage preparation course is a requirement for getting married in a Catholic Church. But think of all the preparation you have done for your career or job. Most of us spend years studying or learning. Think of the preparation taken for your wedding day. Most people spend months planning and many dollars preparing for their wedding. But how much time and effort do we spend preparing for what we hope will last 50 or 60 years â€“ our marriage?. Ask yourself this question, 'Am I willing to spend 20 hours devoted to hearing ideas and learning skills that will help to make my marriage the best it can be?.",
